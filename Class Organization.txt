Class Organization

Classes:

Board
  
  Attributes:
   	*NumPlayers = 2
  	Players # array of Player objects
  	*NumPieces = 4
  	PiecePositions # NumPlayers * NumPieces array
  	Scores # NumPlayers array
  	*ScoreArmSpaces = 6
  	*WidthSpaces = 3
  	BoardLen = HomeArmLen*8 + (WidthBwPlayers-2)*4
  	Winner

  (* = only required for constructor)

  Methods:
    playGame
    updateBoard
  	updateScore
  	endGame # if any Scores == NumPieces, declare winner

Player
  
  Attributes:
  	HomeBase
  	StartPos
  	ScoreBasePos
  	Pieces
  	HomePieces
  	ActivePieces
  	ScorePieces
  	Score

  Methods:
  	rollDie
    makeMove 
      # check to see for which pieces a move is possible
      # pieceToMove = 
      # canHitVal = 0;
      # labels for possible moves: 1) "can hit", 2) "neutral", 3) "bad"
      # for each active piece, if can hit, update canHitVal, update pieceToMove
      # if multiple possible hits, hit piece with larger MoveCount
      # else, check to see if move would be within 6 of opponent (label "neutral" or "bad")
      # if any "neutral", choose one randomly and move
      # else, choose randomly between the "bad"

Piece

  Attributes:
    PlayerID
	  BoardPos = 0
	  ScoreArmPos = 0
	  MoveCount # if MoveCount == BoardLen-2, then go to score base
  
  Methods:
    backToStart
      # update BoardPos
      # update Player HomePieces
    move
      # update BoardPos
      # update HomePos


Rules: 
- have board deal with hits
- repeat turn on 6
- 6 moves piece to board position "1"
- form blocks

Gameplay:
- check to see if entering score arm
- check to see if score arm move is possible

- can't move a piece when:
1) all available pieces in home [x]
2) there is a block
3) would go past score arm

things to test:

1) roll of 6
2) scoring
3) hitting another piece (+ hitting another piece on move out of home base)
4) can't make a move (block)
5) integration test starting from `board.playGame`

figure out how to run tests succinctly.

create analysis code:

- look over files: fix docs/typos

- edit ludo .jpg to show relevant positions for >2 player games

for each game: winner, score, hits, rolls
- save variables in 'gameResults.out' file w/ shelve

- plot player totals: winners, scores, hits, 6's

- plot binom PDF w/player 1's total win probability

- % of time player with more hits and more 6's won (2x2 matrix)
	- player 1's % within each box in this matrix

- plot 3 player game winners totals
- plot 4 player game winners totals

- update README w/notes on analysis folder/files
