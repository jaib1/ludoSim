This repository contains code to create a simple ludo simulator in Python to settle a bet between Pip and Anna.

The root folder contains this 'README', a 'TermsOfBet' file, and the source code that executes when running the ludo simulator. The 'analysis' folder contains code that is used to run the ludo simulator a set number of times, and determine the outcome of the bet. The 'tests' folder contains unit tests (to be run in the 'pytest' framework: follow the instructions in the 'runTest.py' file) for confirming the source code is functioning as expected.

*Note, this package was created within the Anaconda 5.3.0 distribution (running Python 3.7.0), and imports some packages native to Anaconda 5.3.0. For best results, run this code within Anaconda 5.3.0*
